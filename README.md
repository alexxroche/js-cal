## Need a simple calender that you can cut-n-paste ?

Try [js-cal](https://alexxroche.github.io/js-cal/)

## About
Unix programs have long solved many problems. There are problems that you haven't even thought of yet, that they have already solved.

For example: You want a pocket-sized calender for this year. Something that you can have next to your desk, just behind your phone.

cal does this. Not everyone is used to the command line, so rather than printing out cal each January I though I'd port it to javascript.

Before re-inventing the wheel I looked to see if this had been done and found *MANY* javascript calendars, but none of them could cleanly
cut-n-paste into notepad++ or leafepad. 

Here is an example that [looks ok](https://alexxroche.github.io/js-cal/table.html) in the browser, 
but [fails to cut-n-paste](https://alexxroche.github.io/js-cal/fails_cut-n-paste.html).

So I've started from scratch on: [cut-n-paste cal in javascript](https://alexxroche.github.io/js-cal/).
